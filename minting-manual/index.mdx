Upon launch, USDR Stablecoin will be available to be minted in a decentralized process.

The creation of Real USD (USDR) within the RWAX Protocol framework is facilitated through two distinct pathways, each tailored to different user preferences and asset ownership scenarios.

## Direct Minting with Real-World Assets (RWAs)

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Procedure">
    * **Asset Submission:** Individuals can mint USDR by contributing eligible Real-World Assets directly into the protocol. These assets are typically short-term, high-quality securities like U.S. Treasury Bills.
    
    * **Equivalence Minting:** The protocol mints USDR on a 1:1 basis with the deposited RWAs. For every dollar of RWA value deposited, one USDR token is generated.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Points to Consider">
    * The RWAs must comply with the protocol's strict collateral standards for quality and liquidity.
    * This method offers a transparent process where the assets backing the USDR are directly from the user.
  </Card>

## Indirect Minting via USDC

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Procedure">
    * **USDC Transfer:** Users deposit USDC into the RWAX system, which in turn mints USDR at an equivalent rate.
    
    * **Collateral Provider Involvement:** A trusted Collateral Provider (CP) steps in to supply the necessary RWAs to support the newly minted USDR, allowing users to benefit from RWA backing without direct ownership.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Key Considerations">
    * **CP Validation:** Before any indirect minting, the protocol ensures that the CP has adequate and appropriate RWAs.
    * **Associated Costs:** Users should be aware that there could be additional costs for this convenience, reflecting the fees for the CP's service.
  </Card>

## Initial Minting Policy

**Minimum Threshold:** During the early stages post-launch, requests for minting USDR below a certain threshold (e.g., 100,000 USDR) will be directed to engage with secondary market liquidity. This policy helps manage the initial scale of minting activities and maintain ecosystem balance.
