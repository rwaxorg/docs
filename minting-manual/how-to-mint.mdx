      <Card title="RWA Direct Minting">
        Choose this option if you possess eligible RWAs, specify the amount, and initiate the deposit.
      </Card>
      <Card title="USDC Indirect Minting">
        Opt for this if you wish to mint using USDC, enter the desired amount for conversion.
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Asset Verification">
    The protocol will assess the deposited RWAs for direct minting or check the CP's backing for indirect minting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Blockchain Transaction">
    Once the assets are verified, the transaction is processed through the blockchain, resulting in the creation of USDR.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fees">
    Note that blockchain transactions incur gas fees, and indirect minting might involve additional service fees.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    After the transaction settles, users can confirm their USDR balance on the blockchain or via the protocol's dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Measures

  <Card title="Smart Contract Integrity">
    The minting is automated and secured by smart contracts that undergo thorough audits to safeguard against issues like unauthorized minting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decentralized Governance">
    As the ecosystem matures, governance token holders will influence minting policies, including adjustments to the RWA eligibility criteria and CP standards.
  </Card>

This dual minting strategy is crafted to accommodate a broad range of users, from those holding RWAs directly to those preferring the simplicity of using another stablecoin as an intermediary, all while upholding the value and trust in USDR.
