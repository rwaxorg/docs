The RWAX Protocol introduces Real USD (USDR) in order to address several key concerns.

## Centralization's Limitations


  <b>The Challenge:</b> Traditional stablecoins amass significant wealth for their issuers, but this wealth often does not trickle down to the users.
  
  <b>The Solution:</b> USDR seeks to address this by creating a system where the benefits of financial success are shared more equitably.

## Crypto Volatility and User Demand for Stability

The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies makes the need for a stable, reliable digital currency urgent. USDR serves as a bridge, offering the stability of RWAs in a digital format that can be easily integrated into DeFi applications.
