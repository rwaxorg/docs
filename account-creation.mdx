Welcome to the first step of your journey with RWAX. Creating an account is straightforward, but it's vital to do it securely. Here's how you can set up your RWAX account:

## Step 1: Navigate to RWAX Sign Up

- **Visit the RWAX Website or App**:
  Open your browser and go to [rwax.org](https://rwax.org) or download the RWAX app from the App Store or Google Play.
- **Click on 'Sign Up'**:
  Locate and click the **'Sign Up'** or **'Register'** button. This is usually found at the top right corner of the website or on the app's initial screen.

## Step 2: Provide Basic Information

- **Enter Your Email Address**:
  Your email will be your primary identifier. Make sure it's an email you have access to and check regularly.
- **Create a Strong Password**:
  Use a password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid common passwords or easily guessable information.
- **Agree to Terms of Service**:
  You'll need to confirm that you've read and agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.

## Step 3: Wallet Integration

- **Connect or Create a Wallet**:
  RWAX supports self-custody, meaning you control your assets. You can connect an existing wallet or create a new one:
  - **Existing Wallet**: If you have a compatible wallet, connect it by following the prompts. Supported wallets include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.
  - **New Wallet**: If you're new to crypto, RWAX might guide you through creating a wallet like MetaMask directly from their platform.
    - **Save Your Seed Phrase**: This is a set of words that you'll need to recover your wallet if you lose access. Write it down securely and never share it.
    - **Understand the Security**: Your wallet is your responsibility. Back up everything, and keep your recovery phrase in a safe place.

## Step 4: Security Measures

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
  Go to your account settings and enable 2FA for an additional layer of security. Use an authenticator app for better security.
- **Set Up Recovery Options**:
  Ensure you have recovery methods in place, like a backup email or phone number, in case you lose access to your primary login methods.
- **Understand Your Wallet's Security Features**:
  Familiarize yourself with features like hardware wallet support or cold storage if you deal with significant assets.

## Final Thoughts

- **Keep Your Information Private**: Never share your wallet's seed phrase or account details with anyone.
- **Regularly Update Your Security**: Change passwords periodically and keep your device's software up-to-date.
