Now that you've added funds to your RWAX account, it's time to dive into the heart of the platform: trading Real-World Assets (RWAs). Here's how to get started with basic trading:

---

## Understanding RWAs on RWAX

### What are RWAs?
- RWAs on RWAX represent tokenized versions of physical or traditional financial assets like real estate, commodities, or even yield from T-Bills.
- Each tokenized asset aims to mirror the value and performance of the underlying asset.

### Asset Diversity
- RWAX offers trading in various asset classes, from precious metals like **gold (XAUT)** to **real estate in major cities**.

## Step 1: Selecting an Asset

### Browse or Search
- Navigate to the **trading section** of the app or website. Here, you can:
  - Browse through different categories of RWAs.
  - Use the search function to find specific assets.

### Asset Information
- Click on an asset to view detailed information, including:
  - **Current price**, historical performance, and market cap.
  - **Asset specifics** like location (for real estate) or purity (for metals).

## Step 2: Placing an Order

### Market Orders
- **Definition**: A market order is executed at the current market price, ensuring a quick trade.
- **To Buy**: Set the amount of the asset you wish to purchase.
- **To Sell**: Specify how much of the asset you want to sell.
- **Execution**: The trade happens immediately at the best available price.

### Limit Orders
- **Definition**: A limit order allows you to specify the price at which you're willing to buy or sell.
- **Buy Limit**: Buy only if the price drops to or below your set limit.
- **Sell Limit**: Sell only if the price rises to or above your set limit.
- **Execution**: The order will only execute if the market price meets your limit. If not, your order remains in the order book until it does or until you cancel it.

## Step 3: Understanding Transaction Details

### Order Confirmation
After placing your order, you'll receive a confirmation with details such as:
- **Order ID**
- **Asset name**
- **Quantity**
- **Price** (for limit orders)
- **Transaction fee**

### Transaction Fees
- Be aware of the fees for each trade, which might be a flat rate or a percentage of the trade amount.

### Slippage
- For market orders, understand that there might be slight price differences between when you place the order and when it's executed due to market volatility.

## Step 4: Monitoring Your Trades

### Trade History
- Check your **transaction history** to see completed trades, pending orders, and any fees incurred.

### Price Alerts
- Many platforms allow setting **alerts for price movements**, helping you stay on top of when to act on your limit orders.

### Portfolio
- Regularly review your **portfolio** to assess how your RWAs are performing against market trends.

---

## Additional Considerations

### Liquidity
- Some RWAs might have less **liquidity** than others, impacting how quickly you can trade at your desired price.

### Market Hours
- While crypto markets run 24/7, specific RWAs might have **trading hours** or be influenced by traditional market hours.

### Risk Management
- Start with smaller trades to get a feel for the market.
- Understand that all trading involves risk; only trade what you can afford to lose.
