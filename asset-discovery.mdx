## Step 2: Detailed Asset Research

### Asset Page Overview
When you click on an asset, you'll typically see:
- **Current Price**: The latest trading price.
- **Historical Data**: Charts showing price movement over time.
- **Asset Description**: Detailed information about what the asset represents, its physical counterpart, or how it's tokenized.

### Research Tools and Metrics
#### Performance Metrics
- **Price History**: Use charts to analyze trends, volatility, and seasonal patterns.
- **Market Cap**: Understand the asset's size in the market.
- **Volume**: High trading volume can indicate liquidity and interest.

#### Fundamentals
- **For Real Estate**: Look into property details like location, zoning, tenant occupancy, and yield potential.
- **For Commodities**: Check supply/demand forecasts, industrial use, and geopolitical factors affecting prices.

#### News and Analysis
- Some platforms provide or link to news, analyses, or expert opinions related to specific assets.
- External resources like commodity reports or real estate market analyses can offer deeper insights.

#### Tokenomics
- If the RWA is tokenized, understand the **token structure**, any yield, and how the token's value is tied to the asset.

## Step 3: Using RWAXâ€™s Research Features

### Education Section
- Some platforms offer learning materials or webinars about how to research assets.

### AI Tools
- If available, leverage AI for sentiment analysis or predictive analytics regarding an asset's future performance.

### Community Insights
- Look for forums or social features where other traders might share their analysis or experience with particular RWAs.

---

## Step 4: External Validation

### Cross-Reference
- Don't rely solely on platform-provided data. Check asset details against **external databases** or reports.

### Regulatory Compliance
- Ensure the asset complies with legal standards where applicable, especially for real estate or financial instruments.

### Market Sentiment
- Use social media, specialized forums, or news aggregators to gauge broader market sentiment.

## Step 5: Portfolio Fit

### Diversification
- How does adding this RWA fit into your existing portfolio? Does it diversify or concentrate your risk?

### Risk Assessment
- Consider the **volatility** and **liquidity** of the asset in line with your **risk tolerance**.

---

## Step 6: Continuous Monitoring

### Set Alerts
- Use RWAX's **notification system** to get alerts on price changes, news, or when the asset hits certain thresholds you're interested in.

### Regular Reviews
- **Markets** and underlying asset values can change; **regular reassessment** is key.

## Final Considerations

### Due Diligence
- Never skip **thorough research**. The digital nature of RWAs doesn't eliminate the need for traditional due diligence.

### Stay Informed
- The world of RWAs can move fast, with new assets being added or existing ones changing in valuation due to **real-world events**.

### Use Tools Wisely
- Leverage the tools RWAX provides but always validate with your own analysis or external sources.
