description: 'Core components and mechanisms of the USDR ecosystem'
---

RWAX has developed USDR and the surrounding product ecosystem, comprising these main elements.

## Core Components

### Asset Integration
USDR serves as a nexus for integrating diverse tokenized real-world assets:

* It aggregates various asset types into a singular, accessible stablecoin
* USDR facilitates broader participation in markets typically reserved for institutional investors
* Its impact is evidenced by the increased capital flow observed in partnering entities

## User Engagement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Conversion">
    Users convert their USDC into USDR
  </Step>
  <Step title="Staking">
    USDR can be staked into a yield-bearing version, USDR+
  </Step>
  <Step title="Governance">
    Over time, users can accumulate governance tokens that represent partial ownership of the protocol
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Protocol Architecture


**Asset Aggregation**: The protocol's foundation is designed as a sophisticated liquidity magnet, pooling resources to invest in short-term, secure assets like tokenized Treasury securities, with all proceeds funneled into a community-controlled treasury.
