Real USD (USDR) is a stablecoin supported by short-term Real-World Assets (RWAs), focusing on U.S. Treasury Bills, to offer a stability level that is exceptional in the dynamic landscape of digital finance. This model opens up avenues for individuals to engage with assets that are generally accessible only to more institutionalized entities, enabling a wider audience to participate without the traditional financial sector's involvement.

In its operational model, USDR introduces a novel strategy for issuance where each token's creation is directly tied to the value of its backing assets, simplifying the process and enhancing security by circumventing the risks associated with banking practices like fractional reserves. The security of USDR is reinforced by the stability of U.S. Treasury securities, providing a solid base for its valuation.
