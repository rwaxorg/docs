## Collateral Strategy

USDR's collateral strategy is rooted in RWAX's commitment to a stringent risk policy, where assets are backed solely by secure, short-duration securities like U.S. Treasury Bills through mechanisms such as overnight repos. The selection of initial collateral has been the result of thorough due diligence on potential market partners, aiming to minimize counterparty and default risks. This careful approach ensures that USDR provides a level of security potentially higher than that of its peers.


## Initial Collateral Partnership

  <Card title="Partnership Strategy">
    The first collaborator in the collateralization of USDR will be a partner chosen for its alignment with RWAX's objectives. This initial phase aims to set a precedent for future partnerships, with the ultimate goal of decentralizing USDR's collateral base. This diversification will be guided by community governance, ensuring that new collateral sources are vetted and approved in a transparent manner.
