---

To start trading on RWAX, you'll need to add funds to your account. Here's a detailed guide on how to do that:

## Step 1: Access the Deposit Section

- **Navigate to Funding**:
  From your dashboard, find and click on the **'Deposit'** or **'Add Funds'** option. This is generally found in the account settings or directly from the main menu.

## Step 2: Choose Your Funding Method

RWAX supports various methods for adding funds, including:

### Cryptocurrency Deposits:
- **Supported Cryptocurrencies**:
  Typically, RWAX allows deposits in major cryptocurrencies like ETH, USDT, USDC, etc. Check the platform for the latest list.
- **Generate a Deposit Address**:
  Click on the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit. You'll be given a unique address or QR code where you can send your crypto from another wallet or exchange.

### Stablecoins:
- RWAX supports direct stablecoin deposits. This might be listed separately for ease of use with assets like **DAI**, **USDM**, or other tokenized assets.

## Step 3: Transfer Your Funds

- **Send Cryptocurrency from Your Wallet**:
  Copy the deposit address provided by RWAX into your external wallet or exchange from where you're transferring the funds.
  - Ensure you're sending the correct cryptocurrency to the correct address. Sending the wrong asset can result in the loss of funds.

- **Transaction Details**:
  - **Network**: Make sure you're using the correct blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet for ETH or ERC-20 tokens).
  - **Amount**: Decide how much you want to deposit, keeping in mind any minimum deposit requirements or transaction fees.

- **Confirm the Transfer**:
  Double-check all details, then confirm the transfer in your source wallet. Keep a record of the transaction ID for tracking purposes.

## Step 4: Wait for Confirmation

- **Transaction Processing**:
  Cryptocurrency transactions can take from a few minutes to several hours to be confirmed, depending on network congestion.
- **Check Transaction Status**:
  Use the transaction ID to check your transaction status on a blockchain explorer if you're concerned about delays.
- **Funds Availability**:
  Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, your funds should appear in your RWAX account. This might be instant or take a few minutes to reflect.

## Step 5: Verify Your Deposit

- **Check Your Balance**: Revisit your account balance or portfolio to confirm the deposit has been credited.
- **Discrepancies**: If your funds don't appear, check:
    - If enough time has passed for network confirmations.
    - That you sent the correct asset to the correct address.
    - Contact support if you believe there's an issue.

# Additional Tips

### Fees
- Understand any **network or platform fees** associated with deposits. These fees might be deducted from your deposit amount, so always account for them when transferring funds.

### Security
- Always **double-check the address** you're sending to. Even a small typo could result in the loss of your funds.
- Consider sending a **small test transaction** before transferring large amounts to ensure the address is correct and the process works as expected.

### Record Keeping
- Keep **detailed records** of all transactions, including deposit addresses, transaction IDs, and timestamps. These records are crucial for financial tracking, tax purposes, and in case of disputes or errors.
