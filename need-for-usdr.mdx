## Decentralized Infrastructure for Financial Stability

<Note>
Rather than simply replicating Tether's model, USDR aims to Foster Decentralized Governance. Unlike traditional stablecoins where governance is centralized, USDR enables its community to have a voice in its operations, ensuring decisions reflect the collective interest..

## Enhancing DeFi with True Asset-Backing

The recent financial crises have highlighted the precariousness of banking-centric collateral models.

### Security Against Systemic Failures

USDR's backing by short-term, high-quality assets provides a layer of security against the systemic risks posed by traditional banking, aiming for a model that is inherently more resilient.

## Empowering Users through Participation
